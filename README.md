# REDDEMPUS
- The name consists out of "redde" and "tempus" which derives from the latin and means "pay" and "time"

# IDEA
- This project is realized for a specific region ("Südtirol"). You can fork this project and realize it in your own region if you wish
- The idea behind the project is, that people who get bored in their free time or people who want to do something they like can look for tasks to do.
- The tasks are created by other registered users on the project that need help with something.

- Example: 
    - Someone needs help with fixing a computer problem. 
    - They create a task, where they put in their location, duration of the task and additional informations.
    - Other users see the task and help the person with solving their problem
    - In exchange the user who completes the task gets payed in "time" currency and that "time" gets removed from the task giver.
